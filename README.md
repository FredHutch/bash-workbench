A dataset manager for bioinformaticians

The world is awash in data, but research communities tend to organize their data in different ways.
The BASH Workbench is a dataset manager for people who tend to organize their data as collections of files.
The goal of this utility is to make it easier to keep track of where your datasets are, remember how they were made, and quickly create new ones based on easily-sharable BASH templates.
